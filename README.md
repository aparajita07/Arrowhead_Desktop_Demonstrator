# Arrowhead Desktop Demonstrator (Java Spring-Boot)
The Desktop demonstrator is a SOS with several temperature sensors and one servo motor wh√≠ch will behave as service providers in the arrowhead framework and the consumer has the algorithm which relates the temperature sensors and servo motor.The consumer is able to change orchestration at run time so that it can switch between temperature sensors.

## Setting up the hardware

### Hardware used

- Raspberry Pi 4 B/B+
- Two 1-wire temperature sensors
- Servo motor
- Breadboard
- 4.7k Ohm resistor

### Connecting the wires
